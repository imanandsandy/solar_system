# solar_system
This code provides an engaging visual representation of the solar system with planets and their orbits. The use of CSS animations for the planets' rotations and orbits adds interactivity and aesthetic appeal. However, it's important to note that this is a static representation and doesn't provide real-time information or interactive features related to the solar system.
